Code adapted from 
https://www.codeproject.com/Tips/1175658/Session-Expiration-Popup

look at the refactor.

Code for this timer must get a message from server on time remaining for session.

When time out approaches uses a client side quick check to approximate time left.

This code doesn't run since there is no associated backend, further more I didn't optimize for JPSM in the refactor.
